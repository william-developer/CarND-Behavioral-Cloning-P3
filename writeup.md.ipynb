    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 91). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (model.py lines 105 shuffle). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 105).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road. I modified the steering angles slightly on the left and right camera angles which brough more data and improved underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to predict the steering angles based on the driving condition of the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the naivid model. I thought this model might be appropriate because It was a reliable, mature model. But it still needed to be tuned in a specific scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was over fitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model(adding dropout layer) so that it worked well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I retrained the model, and saved it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track,such as bridge. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I converted the image type from BGR to RGB.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle was able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a visualization of the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I first tried to recorde one laps on track one using center lane driving. But it was difficult for me to create a high quality data set. So I used sample data to train the model. Here is an example image of center lane driving:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data set, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would increase the amount of data. For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "After the collection process, I had 38572 number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by function Lambda which was very convenient to make data normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 5 as evidenced by validation loss and training loss. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.\n"
